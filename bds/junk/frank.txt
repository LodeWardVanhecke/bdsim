Subject: optics file for short bds

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII




Hi Grahame,

last night I have created an optics file for the
short collimation system + comact final focus. 
The file is called 

testoptics_collshort 

The initial values of the optical functions 
are different in this file, namely 

betx0 = 64.171
alfx0= -1.95133 
betay0= 18.2438
alfy0= 0.605865

(these come from Daniel's linac simulations.)

I believe that you already have two
optics files, namely 
 
for the original baseline design 
(long collimation system + conventional
final focus) called testoptics, 

and for the hybrid (long collimation system
+ compact final focus) called  
testoptics_short 

For these two designs we had used 

betx0 := 65
alfx0 := 0.
bety0 := 18
alfy0 := 0.

In the present new file the spoiler apertures
should be set to about 

energy spoiler gap +/- 4 mm 
beta_x spoiler gap +/- 95 micron
beta_y spoiler gap +/- 104 micron

I did not include these values in the file
since I do not remember if you need the
half aperture or the full aperture as input.

I hope that you have the corresponding 
values for the other optics (I think some apertures
were included in the file testoptics; I do not
remember the situation for testoptics_short -
the aperture here should be similar, but sqrt(2) 
smaller for beta_x). Also in these two decks
we probably should tighten the energy collimation 
by a factor of 3 or 4 (to take into account 
the failure mode study that Daniel and I did last
year). This reduction is already included in 
the above numbers for testoptics_collshort

Well, I think this should get you started on
the comparison. Please let me know if you have
any questions. 

I have suggested to Ralph to organize a FAT/CLIC
meeting next week Tuesday afternoon, hoping that
you will be back at CERN then. 

Cheers,
        Frank
