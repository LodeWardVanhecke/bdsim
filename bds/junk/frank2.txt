Subject: collimation study 




Hi Grahame,

do you remember to send me the apertures and 
collimation amplitudes? (I would like to see 
that they look ok and consistent) 

The nominal emittances should be 0.68 micron (x)
and 0.01 micron (y).  I believe that initially we assumed
0.02 micron in y. So the apertures in the first longer
system (and your distribution) might now not be correct. 

By the way something that would be interesting to 
plot is the particle distribution at the entrance 
or center of the final doublet, in particular the 
particles which are outside of 12 sigma_x and 
80 sigma_y.

Cheers,
        Frank
