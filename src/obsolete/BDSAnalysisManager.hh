 * @brief Analysis interface class. Create, store and access histograms.

 * however this does not inherit it nor adhere strictly to it. The
 * purpose of this class is only to deal with histograms. The Geant4
 * AnalysisManagers are based on an output format.  Here this will 
 * be a communal histogram class and storage system and the different
 * output formats will write them appropriately.
